# NN Verification using Symbolic Intervals with Fresh Variables

## Installation

Using the Julia package manager (type `]` in the Julia REPL) type
- `add https://github.com/phK3/NeuralVerification.jl#BuildingBranch` (adds my fork of `NeuralVerification.jl` to the environment)
    - at least use my fork, until installation of the original Repo is no longer broken
